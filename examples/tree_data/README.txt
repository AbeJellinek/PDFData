This example demonstrates a simple real-world application of PDF data storage. The PDF [tree_data.pdf] in this folder contains two main elements: a visual table of tree locations in the city of Palo Alto (taken from public data), and the embedded data file itself. To view the data, go to [https://pdf.abe.im] and upload the PDF file. A table similar to the one in the document should be displayed. Choose a download option to view the data as any number of formats.
